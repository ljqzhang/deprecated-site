<div class="body"><h3>Introducing Rumble</h3>
    <p>Rumble is a concept for a mobile app that aims to <b>help college students cook</b> and meal prep. Rumble <b>suggests recipes</b> that are healthy, low-cost and easy-to-prepare based on <b>ingredients the user already owns</b>.</p>
        <p></p>
       <p><b>TEAM:</b> Will Fischer, Leslie Zhang, Matt Zients</p>

<h3>"Houston, we have a problem!"</h3>
            <p>Rumble was born out of a problem my teammates and I shared: We were all newbies at living alone and—whether out of sheer laziness, ignorance or a combination of both—<b>we were terrible at cooking for ourselves</b>.</p>
            
            <p>We learned that this wasn't an isolated issue. In fact, <b>40%</b> of over a hundred Northwestern students surveyed <b>purchased lunch</b> on most days, a habit that effectively has financially precarious students bleeding money.</p>
            
            <p><b>86%</b> of total respondents said <b>an app that helped with cooking</b> and meal prep would pique their interest.</p><br>
            <h1>We created Rumble with busy college students in mind. That means tasty, healthy recipes that use what's in the fridge to create many packable servings for under $10, in under 40 minutes, without any fancy kitchen tools.</h1>
            <br><br>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <h4>Fridge Inventory</h4>
            <h4>Recipe Variety</h4>
            <h4>Personalization</h4>
            <h4>Social Side</h4>
            <br><br>
            
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Working on Rumble allowed my team to tackle a widespread problem that we were also personally affected by. There are a lot of pre-existing solutions out in the world—the most obvious being meal kit services—that we could study to guide our process.</p>
            <p>We had to identify what wasn't working, and try to create a solution that wasn't a rehashing of what's already out there without being so fresh that people wouldn't get on board.</p>
            <p>One major learning moment was when we were toying with the idea of making Rumble super social. We were thinking about linking it to social media platforms and allowing friends to swap recipes. </p>
            <p>During research, one person we spoke to suffered from an eating disorder and stressed that any social or public aspect of the app would be pretty horrific for her. It made me realize that building that in as a fixture could have created a lot of harm.</p>
            <p>I also got to try out Figma for the first time, which was super exciting. I taught myself the ropes as I went and simultaneously had a lot of fun. As a PC user, I don't have access to Sketch. Figma filled that gap for me, and I'm excited to use it more in the future.</p>
